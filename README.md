# DataStructures-Iterable
CSCI 340 Data Structures Assignment
#Program1
• Use Iterable interface defined in java.lang package as a generic type Iterable<T> T type parameter (type of elements returned by the iterator)
• Use for-each loop for iterating over collections.
• Show iterating over a List collection with String,Integer, and Double objects as elements
• Write programs that use Iterable interface.

#Program2
• Write programs that use Recursive algorithms.
• Use Divide-and-Conquer algorithm design paradigm.
• Use Sorting algorithms to solve computational problems.
